## Lab 06

Today I will be creating the react application in which I will be building this project with in the same manner as my gallery of horns project. Generate the files from my terminal using create-react-app city-explorer then importing them to GitHub. After my initial setup is complete (which is being done on a branch named setup rather than on the main), I will create a branch to commence my work on. The order of operations for today is layed out on a Trello board.
