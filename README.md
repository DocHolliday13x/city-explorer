# City Explorer

* *Author*: Ryan Eastman

* *Version*: 1.0.0

## Project Overview

* *Description*: City Explorer is a Code Fellows 301 Lab exercise in which we will begin working with NODE.js and APIs.

* *Current State of Development*: Functioning Front-End Application

## Lab 06

Today I will be creating the react application in which I will be building this project with in the same manner as my gallery of horns project. Generate the files from my terminal using create-react-app city-explorer then importing them to GitHub. After my initial setup is complete (which is being done on a branch named setup rather than on the main), I will create a branch to commence my work on. The order of operations for today is layed out on a Trello board.

* Name of Feature: API
* Estimate of Time Needed to Complete: Not 6 hours
* Start Time: 1300
* Finish Time: 1922 
* Actual Time to Completion: 6 hours

## Lab 09

Today's goal is to refactor the front and back end of my application. I don't know if refactoring will make it run smoother, but it sure cleaned up my code nicely. Everything is more readable.

* Name of Feature: Refactor - Modularize the back-end codebase.
* Estimate of Time Needed to Complete: 15 hours
* Start Time: 23 MAR 2023 1130
* Finish Time: 23 MAR 2023 1700
* Actual Time to Completion: < 6 hours

## Lab 10

Today's goal is to utilize cache to maximize API accessibility. In order to achieve this, I will create an object in my server code to hold the API response data for any proxied queries. That way my back end can first check to see if there is already information about a given city and, if there is, send the data directly from the storage object, without concerns of being rate-limited by the API providers.
